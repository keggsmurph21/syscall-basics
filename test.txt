Hello, world!  This is a much longer message than before, so maybe we'll only get the first 255 bytes? Or something like that. Hm, maybe not, since I still printed out my whole message to the screen.  I guess I just haven't written enough characters yet, so I'll keep rambling to finish this sentence.  Vim tells me I've already written 300+ chars, so I think this should be enough.
